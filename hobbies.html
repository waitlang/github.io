                    <h3>Making drinks</h3>
                    <p>I am the "coffee guy" in our group, mainly because I have spent 3 years brewing different kinds of coffee
                        with different brewers. But I'm not just a coffee guy, my interests on other drinks spike on and off as
                        I stumble across them. I've tried cocktails, tea, matcha, and is recently obsessed with tablea.</p>

                    <h3>Computers</h3>
                    <p>The reason I pursued IT is for my <i>general</i> knowledge of computers that I wanted to expand on. My
                        interest with different fields come and go, especially when I had to focus on our college curriculum,
                        but back then I would often tinker with software out of curiosity. I went as far as installing Linux to
                        dual boot on top of my Windows PC, and even installing ChromeOS on my laptop. In college though, I just
                        try my best to stay interested on my classes.</p>

                    <h3>Urban Planning</h3>
                    <p>To quote my friend: "This guy sweats Google Maps". I think this is a very uncommon interest unless I
                        enroll on an engineering or architecture class. The only game I play on my PC is Cities:Skylines, a
                        sandbox city building game. If it isn't that, it's creating urban designs on Google Earth or
                        Illustrator.

                    <h3>Cosplaying</h3>
                    <p>While past my prime, I used to cosplay almost every Sunday at Session Road and on most conventions with
                        friends back in 2022-2023. This hobby is about how you can portray a character with clothes and
                        costumes, and also how you match the personality of them. I enjoyed how we would often modify characters
                        to fit a theme, which meant we'd also have to modify our clothes and personality.</p>
